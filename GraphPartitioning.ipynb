    "# Graph partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "An implementation of graph partitioning using an Ising model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "Consider a graph $G=(V,E)$ with an even Number $n=|V|$ of vertices and edges $E$. What is an partitioning of $G$ into *two subsets*, such that both subsets have the *same number of vertices* $n\\over 2$ and the *number of connecting edges between the sets is minimized*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ising model\n",
    "Associate with each vertice a value $s_i=\\pm 1\\;(i=1,\\dots,n)$ where the two different values denote in which of the subsets each vertice lies.  \n",
    "The classical hamiltonian $H=AH_A + BH_B$ consists of two parts, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_A = (\\sum_i s_i)^2 = n + 2\\sum_{i,j;i<j}s_is_j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the constraint for the sets having the same size and should be $0$ for ground states and the square taking part of making more down spins also a penalty and \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_B = \\sum_{ij\\in E} (1 - s_is_j)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is the function to be minimized. If an edge connects two vertices of the same group the term evaluates to $0$, if it connects two vertices of different groups the term becomes $2$ and suc edges therefore get penalized.  \n",
    "(Note that for choosing $B<0$ we get the corresponding problem of maximizing the connecting edges.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For finding a lower bound for $A$ consider the maximal gain in energy for breaking the constraint by flipping one spin in an even partition $\\Delta H_B = 2B\\min({d,n/2})$ where $d$ is the maximal number of vertices one vertice in the graph can be connected to. The minimal penalty in energy for such violations is $\\Delta H_A = 4A$. We need $ \\Delta H_B \\leq \\Delta H_A $ in order for the penalty to compensate any energy gain by breaking the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "So as an lower bound for $A$ we get\n",
